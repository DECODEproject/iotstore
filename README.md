# iotstore

Implementaton of proposed datastore interface for the DECODE IoTPilot/Scale
Model.

Uses an experimental template structure from here:
https://github.com/thingful/go-build-template

## Building

Run `make` or `make build` to build our binary compiled for `linux/amd64`
with the current directory volume mounted into place. This will store
incremental state for the fastest possible build. To build for `arm` or
`arm64` you can use: `make build ARCH=arm` or `make build ARCH=arm64`. To
build all architectures you can run `make all-build`.

Run `make container` to package the binary inside a container. It will
calculate the image tag based on the current VERSION (calculated from git tag
or commit - see `make version` to view the current version). To build
containers for the other supported architectures you can run
`make container ARCH=arm` or `make container ARCH=arm64`. To make all
containers run `make all-container`.

Run `make push` to push the container image to `REGISTRY`, and similarly you
can run `make push ARCH=arm` or `make push ARCH=arm64` to push different
architecture containers. To push all containers run `make all-push`.

Run `make clean` to clean up.
